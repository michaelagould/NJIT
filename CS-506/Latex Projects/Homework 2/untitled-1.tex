1. Use \textbf{contra-positive proof} method for each of the following.\\
(a) There are 10 boxes.  Prove that if 40 balls are placed in the boxes, then at least one box has four or more balls.\\
(b) Let $x$ be a real number.  Prove that if $x^2$ is irrational, then $x$ must be irrational.

2. Use \textbf{contrapositive proof} for each of the following, where the domain of $n$ is positive integers.\\
(a) Prove that if $n^2$ is not divisible by 3, then $n$ is not divisible by 3.\\
(b) Prove that if $n^2$ is divisible by 3, then $n$ is divisible by 3. (Hint: If $n$ is not divisible by 3, then $n = 3k +r$, where $k$ is an integer quotient and $r$ is a non-zero remainder, $r$ \include{1,2}.)

3. Let $x$ and $y$ be two real numbers and let $A = (x + y)/2$.  We want to formally prove that if $(x > y)$ then
$$x < A < y$$

You are not allowed to state it as a known fact that the average of two values fall between those two values!  Rather, you must provide a formal proof in two ways:

(a) \textbf{Direct Method}; and\\
(b) \textbf{Contrapositive Method}.

Hints: For direct proof, assume $x < y$
